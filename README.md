## Rules

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte@next

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

> Note: the `@next` is temporary

## Developing

Anywhere pnpm is mentioned npm can be replaced.

First install the dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The production build can be previewed by `pnpm run preview`.

## Svelte Adapter

The static adapter is used.
